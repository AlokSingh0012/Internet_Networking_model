Networking Model Project
Overview

The Networking Model project is a comprehensive exploration and implementation of networking concepts, protocols, and architectures. This project aims to provide a clear and detailed understanding of how computer networks function, including both theoretical foundations and practical applications. By studying and working on this project, you will gain valuable insights into various networking layers, communication protocols, and network design principles.
Features

    Layered Approach: The project is structured around the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, breaking down networking into seven distinct layers. Each layer's functionality, protocols, and interactions will be studied and demonstrated.

    Protocol Deep Dive: Detailed examination of key networking protocols such as TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, and more. You will implement these protocols from scratch to grasp their inner workings.

    Hands-on Labs: Engage in hands-on labs and exercises that simulate real-world networking scenarios. You will configure routers, set up virtual networks, and troubleshoot connectivity issues.

    Network Security: Gain an understanding of network security principles, including encryption, authentication, and intrusion detection. Implement security measures to protect data transmission and network integrity.

    Scalability and Performance: Explore techniques for designing scalable and high-performance networks. Learn about load balancing, Quality of Service (QoS), and network optimization.
